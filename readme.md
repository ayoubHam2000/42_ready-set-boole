## Ready Set Boole

Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with variables that have two distinct values: true (1) and false (0). Named after George Boole, it is fundamental in digital logic design and computer science.


Truth Tables: Tables that show the result of a Boolean operation for all possible values of the variables involved.

Negation Normal Form (NNF) and Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) are ways to standardize logical expressions in Boolean algebra.

Negation Normal Form (NNF)

Definition: NNF is a logical expression where:

    The only negations (NOT operators) are directly applied to variables.
    The expression uses only AND (⋅) and OR (+) operators besides NOT.
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)

Definition: CNF is a standardized logical expression that is a conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals (variables or their negations).





Gray Code

Gray code, or reflected binary code, is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
It’s commonly used in digital systems to prevent errors during the transition between consecutive values
Gray code can be converted to and from binary and decimal numbers.
- gray_code(n) = n ^ (n >> 1)


Sets theory
Set theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics that studies collections of objects
